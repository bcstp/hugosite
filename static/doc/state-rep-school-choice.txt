Dear Representative Raney,

As a Constituent, I want you to know I believe that School Choice is one of the most critical issues that must be addressed in this Legislative Session.  Across Texas, parents are frustrated by our public schools, and the obvious way to fix this situation is by giving parents the leverage they need to allow Texas parents the ability to choose the best education option for their children. 

Education freedom is widely supported by Republican voters. Over 83% in Brazos County and 87% of Texas Republicans statewide supported School Choice in the 2022 Primary Election.  Texas children deserve quality education and this can be best accomplished through School Choice. 

I realize there will be various School Choice bills which will make the process difficult to determine the most efficient and effective way to accomplish this task.  Please stand firm in supporting legislation that will allow parents to choose what’s best for their children and also allow home school parents to opt out if they so choose.    

Please take action to support School Choice and advocate for legislation to accomplish this goal.  

Very best regards,
