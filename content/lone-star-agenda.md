The 86th Texas Legislative Session failed miserably to enact the priorities that the Republican Party of Texas made explicitly clear to the political leadership of Texas.  As a result, many now consider the political landscape in Texas to be Purple and leaning toward Blue!

 The Lone Star Agenda – Save Texas 2020 Plan is a powerful statement of conservative principles, values and actions developed to excite and unify grassroots conservatives to push Republican elected officials to support the priorities of the voters that elect them, not the swamp in Austin.   The Lone Star Agenda will restore the values most Texans hold dear and reaffirm Texas as a unique and vital state to reverse a rising Blue Tide. **This CAN save Texas – and the Presidential Election – in 2020! **  

## <span class="hilite">The Lone Star Agenda - Save Texas 2020 Plan</span> 

### <span class="hilite">Family Rights and Personal Liberty </span>

We place the constitutional rights of Texans to liberty and self-determination for themselves and their families above the desires of government officials and special interests:    

1. Allow families to make mental and physical health decisions for themselves. 
2. Stop wrongful removal of children from families by restoring due process rights for parents. 
3. Stop local ordinances that interfere in private employer-employee relationships. 
4. Increase protections for unborn Texans.  

### <span class="hilite">Transparent and Representative Government </span>

We must reform and protect the Texas institutions that are critical to our historical identity as the Lone Star State:  

<ol start="5">
<li>Improve election integrity (paper ballot backup audit trail; citizenship verification). </li>
<li>End taxpayer funded lobbying. </li>
<li>End union dues withholding from public sector paychecks.</li> 
<li>Protect Texas monuments.  </li>
</ol>

### <span class="hilite">Justice and Security</span>

We must improve the security of Texans to be safe in their communities and free from injustice:    

<ol start="9">
<li>Secure the southern border (interior enforcement to end the “magnet” effect). </li>
</ol>
