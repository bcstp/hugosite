## Our two main goals

### *1. Protect our online privacy*

Big tech companies make money by using our personal data. It's up to us whether we go along with this or not.  

### *2. Stop supporting those companies working against us*

The [Cancel This Company website](https://www.cancelthiscompany.com/) does a good job keeping track of this, with details.

<a name="process" id="process"></a>

## Remember: This is a Process!

As we begin working through escaping Big Tech, remember the following:  

1. **This is a *moving target***. What we know today may well be different tomorrow. We can almost count on it.  
2. **NO ONE knows everything about this.** We must all rely on one another, and check on and help each other. Find those you know who can help, and ask them *to* help. 
3. **Almost *no one* is doing this all perfectly.** Don’t get frustrated and/or overwhelmed in the process! Or at least, work on continually improving *managing* your frustration.  
4. **Sometimes we will have to consider paying for services that we've previously received for "free"**. We have gotten used to using extremely valuable products without having to pay money up front. This has proven to be costly in the long run&mdash;for our privacy, and for our ability to communicate freely.
5. **We may need to learn more about the technical side of communicating online.** Big Tech has taken advantage of our desire not to have to learn more about the details of what happens in the background when we work and converse online. Indeed, they've designed their services to keep us from having to know more.  E.g, we may not need to understand encryption, but we do need to remember to check that our communications *are* encrypted.  
6. **We may need to work more to get things done.** Some things that Big Tech has made easy for us to do, may now require more of our hands-on effort.

Regarding the following, **<span class="hilite">just because you don't use Facebook/Twitter/whatever, doesn't mean you shouldn't consider using the best of the alternative apps listed here!</span> Have a say in our culture and politics!**

<a name="facebook" id="facebook"></a>

## Facebook alternatives

<a name="twitter" id="twitter"></a>

## Twitter alternatives

Note that Twitter alternatives have been becoming more like Facebook alternatives. Facebook has been more long-format posts, image galleries, public and private communities. Twitter started more just making quick statements. 

| Twitter alternative  | Comments  | Recommended?  |
|---|---|---|
| [Parler](https://parler.com/main.php) | - The first to respond to the leftist/Big Tech taunt of "Conservatives, go make your own app!"<br>- They did, and were then kicked off both app stores and their web host<br>- To get reinstated on the Apple App Store and Google Play, what did they have to compromise on though...? | While deserving kudos, there may be better alternatives to Twitter now |
| [Gab](https://gab.com/) | - Probably most hated by the left<br>- Is open source: good<br>- [Follow Cancel this Company](https://gab.com/Table4six)<br>- CTC: ["Is the ONLY online platform that allows free speech..."](https://www.cancelthiscompany.com/News-Alt-Tech-Outlets.html) !<br>- Cancel This Company's favorite  | **YES**  |

<a name="texting" id="texting"></a>

| Messaging alternative  | Comments  | Recommended?  |
|---|---|---|
| Facebook Messenger | Are you ***kidding?!*** |  **NO.** Seriously, delete this app |
| WhatsApp | - [Sold out its users to Facebook](https://www.thenews.com.pk/latest/776144-everybody-can-get-back-to-uninstalling-whatsapp-now-edward-snowden-after-signal-recovers) |  **NO**  |

<a name="youtube" id="youtube"></a>
## YouTube alternatives&mdash;and a workaround

Remember: *YouTube is owned by Google.*

YouTube alternatives are seeming to gain ground; these aren't the only ones. Check for those you'd like to follow, join, and watch!

### Rumble

[Rumble.com.](https://rumble.com/) Interesting note: [Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis Joins YouTube Alternative ‘Rumble’ Following Google Censorship](https://www.breitbart.com/tech/2021/04/17/florida-gov-ron-desantis-joins-youtube-alternative-rumble-following-google-censorship/)   

### Odysee (LBRY)

[Odysee.com](https://odysee.com/). A possible follow: [Rob Braxman, the Internet Privacy Guy](https://odysee.com/@RobBraxmanTech:6)  

### Guntube, and others

When Google/YouTube was threatening to demonitize firearm channels, several alternatives came about. [Guntube](https://www.guntube.org/home) is one example. 

### NewPipe.net: a YouTube...workaround?

[NewPipe](https://newpipe.net/) is an open-source Android-only app, available in the [F-Droid app store](https://f-droid.org/). **It brings in YouTube videos to watch on this app, rather than going to YouTube.** E.g., in the NewPipe app, type in "How to grow tomatoes in Texas". It will show you videos from YouTube, and play them within the NewPipe app.

<a name="amazon" id="amazon"></a>

## Amazon alternatives. Well, since they sell everything, a few alternatives and some suggestions

Note, <span style="font-weight: bold;" class="hilite">Amazon.com is [Cancel This Company's](https://www.cancelthiscompany.com/) #1 boycott target.</span> [How to boycott Amazon](https://www.cancelthiscompany.com/Boycott-Amazon.html).  

> 6/18/2021 - One more huge reason to boycott Amazon: In a brazen attack on free speech, Amazon kicked [America's Frontline Doctors](https://americasfrontlinedoctors.org/) off its web service.  


### E-books / Kindle book alternatives 

(Though if you have a Kindle or find a used one, these sources offer books you can download and load onto it.)  

**[Project Gutenberg](https://gutenberg.org/)** is a great source for free e-books. They've been at it for 50 years. From their website:  

> Amazon sells for money many titles in print and digital format that you can get free from Project Gutenberg...For older (pre-1926) content, there is a good chance that Project Gutenberg has it free of charge, but Amazon will charge money for it.  

**[Open Library](https://openlibrary.org/)** is part of the amazing and always-growing [Internet Archive](https://archive.org/). They claim to have millions of e-books available, including some newer ones on a "borrow" basis.  

**[The Bryan/College Station Public Library System](https://www.bcslibrary.org/digital/)** has a collection of e-books (and [audiobooks](https://www.bcslibrary.org/eaudiobooks/)) to check out. They've also compiled a [list of other sources of free e-books](https://www.bcslibrary.org/wp-content/uploads/ebook_list20120223.pdf).    
### Other purchasing; replacing Amazon

Cancel this Company's **[Good or apolitical companies to support](https://www.cancelthiscompany.com/Good-Companies.html)**  

(There may be a local version of the Cancel This Company website coming up...stay tuned!)  

Until that time though, a possible general list of buying priorities, worst to best, could look something like:  

- Goods/services from countries who hate us
- Goods/services from neutral countries
- Goods/services from ally countries
- Goods/services from U.S. blue states
- Goods/services from U.S. red states
- Goods/services from Texas; and, for the best case scenario,
- **Buying local goods and services from a local, friendly or at least neutral vendor**

<a name="payment" id="payment"></a>

## Payment services alternatives

### Funding/fundraising services

| Payment service  | Comments  | Recommended?  |
|---|---|---| 
|  GoFundMe | Will throw conservative people/groups out of their service as they choose. E.g., [Candace Owens](https://variety.com/2020/digital/news/candace-owens-gofundme-george-floyd-1234627289/), [Voter fraud investigator Matt Braynard](https://www.yahoo.com/now/gofundme-takes-down-conservative-fundraiser-020829908.html) | **NO** |
| [GiveSendGo](https://www.givesendgo.com/) | Christian fundraising | **YES** |
| [SubscribeStar](https://www.subscribestar.com/) | Cancel this Company says "[Fundraising without Big Tech canceling you](https://www.cancelthiscompany.com/Good-Companies.html)" | **YES** |
| Piryx Giving Stream | Used by at least one conservative group | Might prefer the recommended services in this group until more is known |


### One-time payment services

| Payment service  | Comments  | Recommended?  |
|---|---|---| 
| Paypal | Big tech sellouts. [PayPal has CTC's WORST rating](https://www.cancelthiscompany.com/Company-Reviews/PayPal_Review.html); "no redeeming qualities"   | **NO** |
| Venmo | Owned by PayPal; see above | **NO** |
| [AlignPay](https://alignpay.com/about.html) | "‘Cancel culture’ free." (Missed this one at the Sept. meeting; sorry about that) | **YES** |
| [GabPay](https://news.gab.com/2021/08/01/an-alternative-to-paypal-is-coming/) (upcoming) | Gab has been cancelled in almost every way: [read here](https://news.gab.com/2021/08/01/an-alternative-to-paypal-is-coming/); [support them here at dissenter.com](https://shop.dissenter.com/)  | **YES** when available |
| Zelle | Unsure | Might prefer the recommended services in this group until more is known |
| CashApp | Unsure | Might prefer the recommended services in this group until more is known |
| Authorize.net | Seem to be for small businesses | Might prefer the recommended services in this group until more is known |
