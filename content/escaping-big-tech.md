## Intro: This is a Process!

We all experience hazardous situations where we must judge the risk and make decisions on how to deal with those conditions. Some of those situations appear harmless and we ignore the risk, then suffer the consequences later. Big Tech appears to be so helpful that there could be no harm in allowing them open access to our personal information. But this is a Big Mistake.  

As we begin working through escaping Big Tech, remember the following:  

---

### 1. This is a *moving target*

What we know today may well be different tomorrow. We can almost count on it.  

---

### 2. NO ONE knows everything about this 

We must all rely on one another, and check on and help each other. **Find those you know who can help, and ask them *to* help.** 

--- 

### 3. Almost *no one* is doing this all perfectly 

It would require too much of a normal, otherwise productive person’s time.  

**Therefore, don’t get frustrated in the process!** Or at least, work on continually improving *managing* your frustration.  

---

### 4. Sometimes we will have to consider paying for services that we've previously received for "free"

This has proven to be costly in the long run&mdash;for our privacy, and our ability to communicate freely.

---

### 5. As an act of patriotism, we may need to learn more about the technical side of communicating online

Big Tech has taken advantage of our desire not to have to learn more about the details of what happens in the background when we work and converse online. Indeed, they've designed their services to keep us from having to know more.  

E.g, we may not need to understand encryption, but we do need to remember to check that our communications *are* encrypted.
