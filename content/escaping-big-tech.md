## Our two main goals

### *1. Protect our online privacy*

Big tech companies make money by using our personal data. It's up to us whether we go along with this or not.  

### *2. Stop supporting those companies working against us*

And yes, us using free services does help support them. The [Cancel This Company website](https://www.cancelthiscompany.com/) does a good job keeping track of these companies, with details.

<a name="process" id="process"></a>

## Remember: This is a Process!

As we work through escaping Big Tech, remember the following:  

1. **This is a *moving target***. What we know today may well be different tomorrow. We can almost count on it.  
2. **NO ONE knows everything about this** *including* (especially?) the authors of this page!! We must all rely on one another, and check on and help each other. Find those you know who can help, and ask them *to* help. THANK YOU to those who've pointed out errors on this page, and things that were missed. <br>Please do this yourselves if you see out-of-date material or anything needing correcting: <a href="mailto:bcsteaparty@protonmail.com">bcsteaparty@protonmail.com</a> 
3. **Almost *no one* is doing this all perfectly.** Don’t get frustrated and/or overwhelmed in the process! Or at least, work on continually improving *managing* your frustration.  
4. **Sometimes we will have to consider paying for services that we've previously received for "free"**. We have gotten used to using extremely valuable products without having to pay money up front. This has proven to be costly in the long run&mdash;for our privacy, and for our ability to communicate freely.
5. **We may need to learn more about the technical side of communicating online.** Big Tech has taken advantage of our desire not to have to learn more about the details of what happens in the background when we work and converse online. Indeed, they've designed their services to keep us from having to know more.  E.g, we may not need to understand encryption, but we do need to remember to check that our communications *are* encrypted.  
6. **We may need to work more to get things done.** Some things that Big Tech has made easy for us to do, may now require more of our hands-on effort.

Regarding the following, **<span class="hilite">just because you don't use Facebook/Twitter/whatever, doesn't mean you shouldn't consider using the best of the alternative apps listed here!</span> Have a say in our culture and politics!**

<a name="facebook" id="facebook"></a>

## Facebook alternatives 

| Facebook alternative  | Comments  | Recommended?  |
|---|---|---|
| [MeWe](https://mewe.com/) | [Censoring!](https://archive.vn/xLLk9) | **NO** |

---

<a name="twitter" id="twitter"></a>

## Twitter alternatives

**(Is the following possibly not as crucial with the new owner of Twitter?)** Our observation: there is *much* more content getting through without being censored. Some that is, people call out directly to Elon Musk and it appears that he is fixing things. Time will tell.     


| Twitter alternative  | Comments  | Recommended?  |
|---|---|---|
| [Parler](https://parler.com/main.php) | - The first to respond to the leftist/Big Tech taunt of "Conservatives, go make your own app!"<br>- They did, and were then kicked off both app stores and their web host<br>- To get reinstated on the Apple App Store and Google Play, what did they have to compromise on though...? | While deserving kudos, there may be better alternatives to Twitter now |

<a name="texting" id="texting"></a>

## Texting/messaging/calling alternatives

Note that standard SMS texting **is not secure!**  

| Messaging alternative  | Comments  | Recommended?  |
|---|---|---|
| Facebook Messenger | Are you ***kidding?!*** |  **NO.** Seriously, delete this app |
| WhatsApp | - [Sold out its users to Facebook](https://www.thenews.com.pk/latest/776144-everybody-can-get-back-to-uninstalling-whatsapp-now-edward-snowden-after-signal-recovers) |  **NO**  |

<a name="youtube" id="youtube"></a>
## YouTube alternatives&mdash;and a workaround

Remember: *YouTube is owned by Google.*

YouTube alternatives are seeming to gain ground; these aren't the only ones. Check for those you'd like to follow, join, and watch!

### Rumble

[Rumble.com.](https://rumble.com/) Interesting note: [Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis Joins YouTube Alternative ‘Rumble’ Following Google Censorship](https://www.breitbart.com/tech/2021/04/17/florida-gov-ron-desantis-joins-youtube-alternative-rumble-following-google-censorship/)   


### Bitchute

[Bitchute.com](https://www.bitchute.com). Based in the UK. [Community funded](https://www.bitchute.com/help-us-grow/).  Uses SubscribeStar (see below).    

### Odysee (LBRY)

[Odysee.com](https://odysee.com/). A possible follow: [Rob Braxman, the Internet Privacy Guy](https://odysee.com/@RobBraxmanTech:6)  

### Guntube, and others

When Google/YouTube was threatening to demonitize firearm channels, several alternatives came about. [Guntube](https://www.guntube.org/home) is one example. 

### NewPipe.net: a YouTube...workaround?

[NewPipe](https://newpipe.net/) is an open-source Android-only app, available in the [F-Droid app store](https://f-droid.org/). **It brings in YouTube videos to watch on this app, rather than going to YouTube.** E.g., in the NewPipe app, type in "How to grow tomatoes in Texas". It will show you videos from YouTube, and play them within the NewPipe app. 

---

<a name="amazon" id="amazon"></a>

## Amazon alternatives. Well, since they sell everything, a few alternatives and some suggestions

Note, <span style="font-weight: bold;" class="hilite">Amazon.com is [Cancel This Company's](https://www.cancelthiscompany.com/) #1 boycott target.</span> [How to boycott Amazon](https://www.cancelthiscompany.com/Boycott-Amazon.html).  

> 6/18/2021 - One more huge reason to boycott Amazon: In a brazen attack on free speech, Amazon kicked [America's Frontline Doctors](https://americasfrontlinedoctors.org/) off its web service.  


### E-books / Kindle book alternatives 

(Though if you have a Kindle or find a used one, these sources offer books you can download and load onto it.)  

**[Project Gutenberg](https://gutenberg.org/)** is a great source for free e-books. They've been at it for 50 years. From their website:  

> Amazon sells for money many titles in print and digital format that you can get free from Project Gutenberg...For older (pre-1926) content, there is a good chance that Project Gutenberg has it free of charge, but Amazon will charge money for it.  

**[Open Library](https://openlibrary.org/)** is part of the amazing and always-growing [Internet Archive](https://archive.org/). They claim to have millions of e-books available, including some newer ones on a "borrow" basis.  

**[The Bryan/College Station Public Library System](https://www.bcslibrary.org/digital/)** has a collection of e-books (and [audiobooks](https://www.bcslibrary.org/eaudiobooks/)) to check out. They've also compiled a [list of other sources of free e-books](https://www.bcslibrary.org/wp-content/uploads/ebook_list20120223.pdf).    
### Other purchasing; replacing Amazon

Cancel this Company's **[Good or apolitical companies to support](https://www.cancelthiscompany.com/Good-Companies.html)**  

(There may be a local version of the Cancel This Company website coming up...stay tuned!)  

Until that time though, a possible general list of buying priorities, worst to best, could look something like:  

- Goods/services from countries who hate us
- Goods/services from neutral countries
- Goods/services from ally countries
- Goods/services from U.S. blue states
- Goods/services from U.S. red states
- Goods/services from Texas; and, for the best case scenario,
- **Buying local goods and services from a local, friendly or at least neutral vendor**

<a name="payment" id="payment"></a>

## Payment services alternatives

### Funding/fundraising services

| Payment service  | Comments  | Recommended?  |
|---|---|---| 
|  GoFundMe | Will throw conservative people/groups out of their service as they choose. E.g., [Candace Owens](https://variety.com/2020/digital/news/candace-owens-gofundme-george-floyd-1234627289/), [Voter fraud investigator Matt Braynard](https://www.yahoo.com/now/gofundme-takes-down-conservative-fundraiser-020829908.html) | **NO** |
| [GiveSendGo](https://www.givesendgo.com/) | Christian fundraising | **YES** |
| [SubscribeStar](https://www.subscribestar.com/) | Cancel this Company says "[Fundraising without Big Tech canceling you](https://www.cancelthiscompany.com/Good-Companies.html)" | **YES** |
| Piryx Giving Stream | Used by at least one conservative group | Might prefer the recommended services in this group until more is known |


### One-time payment services

| Payment service  | Comments  | Recommended?  |
|---|---|---| 
| Paypal | Big tech sellouts. [PayPal has CTC's WORST rating](https://www.cancelthiscompany.com/Company-Reviews/PayPal_Review.html); "no redeeming qualities"   | **NO** |
| Venmo | Owned by PayPal; see above | **NO** |
| [AlignPay](https://alignpay.com/about.html) | - "‘Cancel culture’ free."<br>- seeing it used more and more  | **YES** |
| [GabPay](https://www.gabpay.com/) | - new since the 2021 meetings<br>- fee of 1.9% plus $0.15  | **YES**  |
| Zelle | From CTC: "Owned by Early Warning Services, LLC, which is owned by Bank of America, Truist, Capital One, JPMorgan Chase, PNC Bank, U.S. Bank, and Wells Fargo." | **NO** |
| CashApp | "Free to send and receive money, stocks, or bitcoin" | Unsure whether they're involved in the culture war |
| Authorize.net | Seem to be for small businesses | Might prefer the recommended services in this group until more is known |

<a name="banks" id="banks"></a>

## Financial / Banking / Investing alternatives

> ***<span class="hilite" style="font-size: 22px;">If Christians would stop investing money in  companies promoting unbiblical values, there would be no culture war in this country...</span>***

> ***<span class="hilite" style="font-size: 28px;">We have that much power in our numbers.</span>***

### Escaping Big Banks

When possible for your situation, consider using:  

- neutral local/regional banks
- neutral local/regional credit unions ([credit unions vs. banks](https://www.mycccu.com/creditunionvsbanks/))
- Recommended by Financial Issues Stewardship Ministries (see below): **[Christian Community Credit Union](https://www.mycccu.com/)**  
- seen recently: [Pro Life Bank](https://www.prolifebank.com/), coming soon

### Investing/Investment Services

Recommended for Biblically responsible investing:<br>
- **[Financial Issues Stewardship Ministries](https://financialissues.org/)** <br> 
- **[Timothy Plan](https://timothyplan.com/)** funds and ETFs

Also recommended: <br>
**[American Conservative Values Fund](https://acvetfs.com/)** (ACVF)

<a name="knowbe4" id="knowbe4"></a>

## The KnowBe4 Cybersecurity Training Program

This cybersecurity training program is being used as an example for the State of Texas. Many cities in Texas have copied the City Of Bryan model for cybersecurity training.  

**Contact us at <a href="mailto:bcsteaparty@protonmail.com">bcsteaparty@protonmail.com</a> to get a link and login credentials for the KnowBe4 Home Course.**

<a name="vpn" id="vpn"></a>

## VPNs

A VPN encrypts your data and routes the traffic through a server in another location. Your Internet Provider doesn’t see what you are looking at online.  [A good article about what VPNs are and are not.](https://www.howtogeek.com/753661/vpn-myths-debunked-what-vpns-can-and-cannot-do/)  

### Recommended (not an exhaustive list)

**[Private Internet Access (PIA) VPN](https://www.privateinternetaccess.com/)**  

- User Friendly
- Cost Effective ($2.99-4.99/month billed annually)
- Lots of options for where to route traffic and they are all pretty reliable servers

**[Proton VPN](https://protonvpn.com/)**  

- can bundle Plus version with ProtonMail Plus for a total of $8/month (2-year billing)


There are many others!

<a name="pw" id="pw"></a>

## Passwords

Two things make a password/passphrase impractical to hack: *randomness/entropy* and ***length***. One way to get both is by using a passphrase generator, like **[Diceware](https://diceware.dmuth.org/?skip_animation)**.  

## Password Managers

These store passwords for an unlimited number of websites. This makes it so you only need to remember one password/passphrase, to access the password manager, and then it remembers all the other passwords for the sites you visit.  

### Recommended

**[1Password](https://1password.com/)** 

- Only commercial password manager that has not been hacked (yet)
- Cost effective (between $2-$10/month)
- User Friendly

**[BitWarden](https://bitwarden.com/)**  

- Open source
- Has a good free option
- Only $10/year for premium (paid yearly)

---

<a name="phones" id="phones"></a>

## Phone Service Providers

AT&T, Verizon, etc. all give to “charities” like Planned Parenthood and La Rasa. They give the excuse that they are matching employee donations. Seriously?

### Recommended

**[PureTalk USA](https://www.puretalkusa.com/)**  

- Reasonable rates ($55/month for unlimited everything) discounts for military/multiple lines/etc.
- Same coverage as AT&T since they use AT&T towers (This still gets money to AT&T, but cuts the amount.)

**[Patriot Mobile](https://www.patriotmobile.com/)**  

- Same rates as PureTalk USA
- Less coverage than PureTalk USA
- They donate to any charity you select, but Planned Parenthood is not an option.

## PHONES. *Not* Apple iPhones, *not* Google Android phones

<strong class="hilite">PHONES MAY BE WEAKEST LINK IN RETAINING OUR PRIVACY.</strong> 99.99% of the smartphone users in the world use an iPhone or Google Android <strike>portable telescreen</strike> phone. ***Please*** consider the best of the following suggested alternatives. 

[Why not iPhones? Click this link.](https://edwardsnowden.substack.com/p/all-seeing-i) (All right, Apple backed down this time. But they showed their hand when they considered it.)  

### 1. Flip phones ("dumb" phones)

Not practical for most people. The older 2G and 3G ones may [be about to not work anymore](https://www.pcmag.com/news/cdma-vs-gsm-whats-the-difference). There are 4G flip phones.   

---

### 2. Monthly, disposable phones 

When bought with cash may retain some privacy, but when choosing an Android won't address our [second main goal above (not supporting, in this case, Google)](#goals).   

---

### 3. *De-googled* Android phones (now we're talkin')

The following phones use the open source part of the Android operating system, without going the next step and connecting directly to Google, as all standard Android phones do.  

#### Brax.me phone

[Rob Braxman Store](https://brax.me/prod/host.php?f=_store&h=rob&p=&version). You'll need to create a free and private account to use the store. We have one of these; it's decent.  

You can also use that link to send Rob Braxman your own Android phone (certain models only, see the AOSP section at the link) and his company will de-google it, for $130.  

#### Freedom Phone

[$500](https://www.freedomphone.com/). Kinda, well, *quite* high for the phone you get. But still, it satisifies our goals of privacy and not supporting big tech companies.    

#### /e/OS Phone 

We mentioned these at our meeting, but it looks like at at the moment /e/OS phones may not be available in the U.S. Though, see next: 
 
#### De-google your own Android phone

This is geeky but doable. So, since [Android is open source](https://source.android.com/), some links (we've not tried these...yet):

- [Lineage OS](https://lineageos.org/) (used on the brax.me phones above)
- [Graphene OS](https://grapheneos.org/) 
- [/e/OS](https://e.foundation/get-started/)

---

### Linux Phones (not even de-googled Android)

#### Pine Phone

[$150-$200](https://www.pine64.org/pinephone/). However, it's still a beta phone.  

#### Librem 5 USA

[$2000](https://puri.sm/products/librem-5-usa/). (!!) Made in USA. <span class="hilite">***This is what it actually costs:*** <br>1. to not support China, <br>**2.** to not be subsidized by service providers and <br>**3.** to not be subsidized by Big Tech (Google and Apple).</span>  

---

### Punkt Phone

[$350](https://www.punkt.ch/en/products/mp02-4g-mobile-phone/#buy) (note: not compatible with Verizon). **A modern 4G "dumb" phone** with Signal as its messaging app. Could be useful as a hotspot for a laptop or tablet with VPN. [Review](https://www.pcmag.com/reviews/punkt-mp02).  

### 2G, 3G, 4G/LTE, 5G. What gets shut down when?

We discussed this at Meeting 3, with dates from [this April 2021 article](https://www.pcmag.com/news/cdma-vs-gsm-whats-the-difference).  

But these may change! (Again!)
