## Potentially a low turnout&mdash;your vote will have more say

The November 7 General Election will include 14 Proposed Amendments for the Texas Constitution: **[see the ballot](/pdf/2023-sample-ballot-final.pdf)**. There will be no public offices on the ballot and this will tempt some folk to ignore this election.  

## The devil is always in the details  

Some of the proposals on the ballot are brief and lack proper explanation, some are long and convoluted, which is typical for ballot propositions. Reading the propositions prompts the question “What does all this actually mean and what impact will they have if they are approved?”  

## The ones that pass will become law

Everyone needs to know that any of the Proposed Amendments that receive a majority vote will become Texas law. We need a firm evaluation of the proposals to vote with confidence and help others understand the issues and importance of this election.  

## Let's welcome back Bill Peacock
