## Back to Outback for the Lone Star Agenda and Empower Texans!

<address>
	<strong>Thursday, August 15</strong>, 2019, 6:30 PM<br>
	<strong><span class="hilite">Outback Steakhouse</span></strong>, 2102 Texas Avenue South, College Station
</address> <br />

## Without enough good people directing them, the Legislature will KEEP GETTING WORSE. However, strength in numbers coming!

The 86th Texas Legislature failed to accomplish the clear and specific expectations set forth by the Texas GOP Legislative Priorities, regardless of the praise touted by the Governor, Lt. Governor and Speaker. *The Legislature’s poor performance will not change* ***unless*** Texas Grassroots Conservatives speak with strength in numbers to elect common sense champions that will pursue Conservative Principles.  

## A needed focus on Conservative Principles

The [Lone Star Agenda, info here](/lone-star-agenda/) (and also [here](https://texasscorecard.com/state/lone-star-agenda-aims-to-unite-texas-republicans/) and [here](https://texasscorecard.com/state/lone-star-agenda-swells-with-signatures/)) has been developed with a focus on Conservative Principles to build unity and excitement among Grassroots Texans. This effort can <strong  class="hilite">Keep Texas Red in 2020</strong> if we work together and stay focused on the timeless Principles of Liberty and Justice For All. 

## Dustin Sensky with Empower Texans, and how we can push this effort forward! 

Destin Sensky serves as a Capitol Correspondent for [Empower Texans](https://empowertexans.com/) and [Texas Scorecard](https://texasscorecard.com/) covering the Texas Legislature. Dustin will be our speaker for this meeting and will discuss how good legislation failed in the 86th Legislature and **how The Lone Star Agenda can turn this situation around.**  

## And check out the new voting equipment

In addition, we will have the new Brazos County voting equipment at the meeting so everyone can check it out and have a trial run with touch screen voting.

## Destin Sensky

Destin Sensky serves as a Capitol Correspondent for Empower Texans and Texas Scorecard covering the Texas Legislature.  

Originally from the Volunteer State, Destin arrived in Houston 12 years ago and has called Texas home ever since. He studied Agricultural Economics, Agribusiness, and Political Science at Louisiana State University, graduating with a Bachelor of Science in May of 2015.  

It was at LSU that Destin first found his passion for politics and became involved with campaigns and conservative causes. During his four years on campus, he served as an intern to U.S. Senator Ted Cruz’s Houston office, worked alongside the Republican Party of Louisiana and the RNC during the 2014 general election, and was elected President of LSU College Republicans and State Financial Director of the Louisiana Federation of College Republicans.  

Immediately following graduation, Destin returned home to Houston where he worked as a Political Associate for Sen. Ted Cruz’s presidential campaign before taking the leap into Texas politics at the state level. He has been a campaign manager and right-hand man to conservative candidates for the Texas House and Texas Senate ever since.  

Now Destin is working to bring Texans the honest and accurate coverage they need to hold their elected officials in Austin accountable.
