## Current Issues. We have 'em

Many current issues have most of us very concerned about the future of our way of life and the liberty we enjoy. The upcoming general election, civil unrest, judicial misconduct, media distortion of facts, wholesale business destruction by quarantining healthy people (!?), and **evil being proclaimed to be good are a mere sampling of the upside-down world we live in today.**  

## Open mic night. Preach it

It’s about time for “Open Mic Night” so get ready. We will spend this meeting time sharing our thoughts and concerns about current issues and how we can overcome these challenges in order to Keep America Great.  

Please make plans to join us for an occasion to be better informed about current issues!
