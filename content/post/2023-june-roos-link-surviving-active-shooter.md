## Robert Roos, CONSERVATIVE member of the European Parliament

A successful entrepreneur and businessman, MEP Robert Roos has been a Dutch Member of European Parliament since July 2019.  

A conservative Euro-skeptic fighting against globalism and for freedom, you may have heard of MEP Roos when his questioning of a Pfizer executive before European Parliament went viral as a result of the executive’s shocking response.  

**[Here is the video of MEP Roos when he was here on June 20:](https://tspantx.com/robert-roos-mep-texas-visit-2023/)** <span class="hilite" style="font-size: 32px;font-weight: bold;">[ROBERT ROOS VIDEO](https://tspantx.com/robert-roos-mep-texas-visit-2023/)</span>
