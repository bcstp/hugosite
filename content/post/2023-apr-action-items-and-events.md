## Keep encouraging our state reps to support school choice

Unfortunately, our two local state reps need to hear from us more: **[House Republicans Join Democrats to Vote Against School Choice in State Budget](https://texasscorecard.com/state/house-republicans-join-democrats-to-vote-against-school-choice-in-state-budget/)**.  

Rhonda Anderson, Director of Grassroots Engagement for Gov. Abbott, has requested that all parents, citizens and activists contact their state reps by email, directly (not through their websites), so that we can also **blind copy/BCC her** at randerson614@yahoo.com and txschoolchoice@protonmail.com.    

Here are our state rep's direct email addresses. John Raney: <a href="mailto:john.raney@house.texas.gov">john.raney@house.texas.gov</a>;  or Kyle Kacel: <a href="mailto:kyle.kacal@house.texas.gov">kyle.kacal@house.texas.gov</a>.
