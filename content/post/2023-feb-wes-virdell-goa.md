Self defense is a basic human instinct that God Almighty has instilled in us all. Defense of ourself, our family and our way of life is validated in the 2nd Amendment to the U.S. Constitution:

The fact that U.S. citizens own (hundreds of?) millions of personal firearms is one of the deterrents that foreign and domestic enemies soberly consider.
