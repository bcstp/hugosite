## The Bryan/College Station Tea Party will not hold a meeting during the month of July 2020.
 
The convoluted coronavirus situation continues to wreak havoc on our lives and most other activities. Many of us made plans to attend the Republican Party of Texas (RPT) Convention scheduled for July 16-19 in Houston. **That event is now being held online**, since the Mayor of Houston unilaterally cancelled the contract with the RPT.

## August meeting: Defending Property Rights with Texas TURF 

Our next meeting is scheduled for August 20, 2020 and our guest speaker will be Terri Hall, Executive Director of Texans United for Reform and Freedom (TURF). Terriâ€™s presentation will be much more informative if you review the **[TURF website](https://www.texasturf.org/)** before the meeting. The website has tons of information about transportation and toll issues that you probably are not aware of. Check it out!
 
We look forward to meeting with you all on August 20.
