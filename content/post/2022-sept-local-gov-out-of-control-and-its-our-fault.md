## We're dropping the ball, in our own communities

The focus of political conversation and attention is typically on issues at the federal level “Inside the Beltway of DC” or even state issues in Austin. At the same time **our local government entities are dealing with matters in our front yard and usually <span class="hilite">we fail to participate in helping make decisions to benefit our community.</span>**   

## Our guest speaker for this meeting will be Mike Southerland.  

Mike is a US. Army veteran with 22 yrs of service, helicopter pilot in Vietnam,  owned, operated and sold two different insurance business in Bryan and served on the Bryan City Council from 2006 - 2020 (two different terms) along with service in many other organizations.  

Mike’s presentation will examine local government, how decisions are made and how citizen influence and pressure can result in better local decisions.   

## Topic: Local Government Is Out of Control and It’s Your/*Our* Fault

(With at least one local example of how to do this right!) Another great topic to learn about!
