<span class="hilite">**SHORT VERSION:**</span> Contact your state legislator (**[John Raney](https://directory.texasscorecard.com/legislators/john-raney)**, **[Kyle Kacal](https://directory.texasscorecard.com/legislators/kyle-kacal)**) and say **NO TO HB 3.**  

<span style="font-size:12px;font-style:italic;">(The following is excerpted from Grassroots America &mdash; We The People, with whom the B/CS Tea Party is of like mind.)</span>

## This is truly an emergency alert! <span style="color:red;">Please give it your full attention!</span>

Grassroots conservatives must go all out now to stop disgusting trojan horse bill HB 3 filed by Republican (?!) State Rep. Dustin Burrows (Lubbock). Remember him? *Burrows was sidekick to self-disgraced former TX House Speaker Dennis Bonnen.*   

**The low bill number means this is a bill Speaker Dade Phelan supports, which means it is a bill Governor Abbott wants.**  There are tentacle placeholder bills over in the TX Senate.  All of this means that HB 3 is a bill we can expect to be fast-tracked by Republicans having their arms twisted.

## What’s so bad about HB 3? It would give the state government AND WHITE HOUSE MORE POWER to do the bad things they've already started.

Deceptively promoted as a curb on the Governor’s executive powers, **HB 3 actually gives “pandemic” its own section in the law, states the “purpose” of the bill is to “strengthen the role(s) of the governor” and smacks Dr. Fauci/Biden/CDC recommendations down on Texas!**  

From HB 3, Sec. 418 A.002(6): “clarify and strengthen the roles of the governor, state agencies, the judicial branch of state government and local governments in the prevention of, preparation for, response to and recovery from a pandemic disaster." <span style="font-weight:bold;color:red;">This should scare the living daylights out of every Texan!</span>

HB 3 doubles down on Abbott's executive orders by putting into law what he's already done under his "emergency" orders AND **gives the federal government more power in Texas by mandating that businesses comply with any orders from the occupiers of the White House and their CDC.** Think about longer shutdowns, government defining “essential” and “non-essential” businesses, prohibitions on gatherings, masking toddlers and double/triple masking yourself! If it becomes law, HB 3 actually makes it easier to sue a business!
