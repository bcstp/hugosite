# <span style="color:red;">MERRY CHRISTMAS!</span>

## AND PLEASE DON'T FORGET...

### Remember to send a note to Texas House Speaker Dade Phelan stating: <span class="hilite">NO DEMOCRAT COMMITTEE CHAIRS!</span>  

Also, we look forward to seeing you at our next meeting—in January!
Our previous email requested your participation in sending a short hand written message to Representative Dade Phelan insisting that only Republicans be appointed as Committee Chairmen. [Here's a link to that email.](https://mailchi.mp/fa51b5ee4606/letter-to-bcs-tea-party-supporters?e=71c4bec959)  


## ASAP please!

Please send your post card or letter as soon as possible and no later than Christmas!

## Also, no December meeting. We'll see everyone again on Jan. 19:

The Bryan/College Station Tea Party will not meet in December 2022. Our next Tea Party meeting will be held on **<span class="hilite">Thursday, January 19, 2023.</span>**  

# <span style="color:red;">And most importantly:</span>

Although this world is consumed with darkness, deception and chaos, we must never lose sight of God’s covenant of redemption and protection to deliver us through the current troubles in His timing not ours.  

Our hope is for the message of Christmas to fill your life with Joy and Peace.  

All the Best of Blessings to you and your family during this wonderful season and throughout the New Year!
