## Help send a message to the upcoming Texas legislature: <span class="hilite">NO DEMOCRAT COMMITTEE CHAIRS</span>

Legislation promoting our Republican Priorities has not been successful in recent years primarily because **the Speaker has appointed Democrats to Chair many of the strategic House Committees** and they have ignored or block our Priorities in various ways. 

## Send a message directly to House Speaker Dade Phelan: <span class="hilite">NO DEMOCRAT COMMITTEE CHAIRS</span>

There is much more to know about this abuse of power, but the issue at the moment is to make your voice heard by sending a message to Dade Phelan, current Speaker and will probably be re-elected Speaker. **<span class="hilite">State that Phelan appoint only Republicans to Committee Chairmanships, not Democrats!</span>**
