## Happy New Year! ELECTION Year! 

This year of 2020 will be an exciting time of campaigning and elections for Federal, State and local offices. The March Primary Election and Runoffs in May will determine which candidates will compete in the November General Election.  

## No regular meeting, so we can <span style="color:#a00">attend the Candidate Forum</span>

The Bryan College Station Tea Party will NOT have a regular meeting in January 2020, because we want you to attend a forum for the CD-17 Congressional Candidates.
