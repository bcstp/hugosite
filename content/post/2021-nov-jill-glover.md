## Our supposed "public servants" ignore the [priorities](https://texasgop.org/priorities/) given them

Our culture is awash with conflicting ideology and messaging that runs counter to the principles of **Liberty, Self-Reliance and Human Dignity in the sight of God.**  We are regularly shocked with decisions made by elected "public servants" that clearly have other motivations than following the will of their constituents.
