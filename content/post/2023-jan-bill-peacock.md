Our guest speaker for this meeting will be **Bill Peacock**, policy director for both the **[Huffines Liberty Foundation](https://huffinesliberty.com/)** and **[The Energy Alliance](https://www.theenergyalliance.com/).**  

Bill’s presentation will focus on **“The Problem with Big Government.”**  

## Wait. There's only one problem?

Stay with us now...Big Government is assaulting our liberties on a daily basis. And while it is important to address these attacks, it is like playing whack-a-mole. 

## Whack-a-mole? My arm's getting tired...but there is a solution that will work

The only sure way to keep Big Government from taking away our God-given liberty is by <span style="font-size:20px;font-style:italic;font-weight: bold;color: #900;">making it small.</span> We'll explore this from the perspective of:

- the Texas budget, 
- property taxes, and 
- the electric grid.  

## Oh, and Happy New Year!

We look forward to seeing you for a great kickoff to 2023!
