## FIRST: a CRUCIAL Texas First Alert: The Time to Act is Now!

### ACT NOW to secure our elections

Follow this link: **[Texas First Alert EMERGENCY](https://www.texasfirst.org/alerts)**

Thanks to Representative Steve Toth, we have a bill, HB5234, that would return elections back to the citizens, taking control out of the hands of the corporations who currently control every aspect of our elections. While putting safeguards in place to ensure that our elections are conducted with accuracy, transparency and accountability, **HB5234 needs to be heard by the House Elections Committee by April 20th** so that we can get this bill to the House floor for a vote.  

Again, Follow this link: **[Texas First Alert EMERGENCY](https://www.texasfirst.org/alerts)** to take action now!
