David grew up in Waco, Texas and his journey through life is one that illustrates **how a person can change for the better and become a leader for positive cultural transformation.**  

After committing his life to Christ in 2007, David has actively served communities and developed innovative approaches to community challenges in and around Central Texas.  

Most recently David was a [Republican candidate for CD-17 U.S. Representative](https://www.facebook.com/saucedoforcongress/).  

David will be sharing with us about 

- his personal journey, 
- nationwide work on the Tea Party Express in 2010,
- community outreach, and 
- what he learned from the CD-17 race.
