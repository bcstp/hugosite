## Election Day is Nov. 3! And early voting is early

The 2020 General Election scheduled for November 3 will include a host of candidates and issues that everyone needs to be aware of and understand prior to casting our votes. Also, **early voting will be held for three weeks starting on October 13**, instead of the normal two weeks. 

## Vote all the way through the LONG ballot 

The ballot will include the Federal, State, County, City, School Board and City Propositions - it will be a very long ballot.  Our meeting will be a review and discussion about candidates and issues on the ballot to be better prepared to vote.  

## Prepare with a sample ballot, and bring it to the meeting if you can	

We encourage you to go to [brazosvotes.org](http://brazosvotes.org/) and download a **[2020 General Election Sample Ballot](http://brazosvotes.org/sites/default/files/inline-files/2020%20General%20Sample%20Ballot.pdf)**, review it before our meeting and bring it with you.  

## Volunteers/helpers/prayer teams welcomed

One example: **the Texas GOP is offering Poll Watcher online training, sessions offered this Friday through Monday.** If you've not received the email from them, and you are interested, let us know at [bcsteaparty@gmail.com](mailto:bcsteaparty@gmail.com).  

If you can help out in other ways, let us know at the meeting!
