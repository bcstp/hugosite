## Big Tech keeps getting bigger

Big Tech appears to be so helpful that there could be no harm in allowing them open access to our personal information in exchange for them giving us free services. As we’re seeing more and more, this has been a Big Mistake. So…  

## We’ve been hoping to do this for a while now

We’ve mentioned at our last few meetings that we’re hoping to have some separate get-togethers to help folks who are interested to begin moving away from those Big Tech companies.  As it turns out, events have led us to go ahead and use our May meeting for the first of these informational, and if you like, hands-on, meetings.  

## If you’re able, bring your laptop! We will help. Or try!

Please join us for a first dive into **Why and How to Escape Big Tech—starting with Google**. We will help you download and install some alternatives to the several major Google services (Mail, Maps, Docs, etc.) that many have come to rely on (or at least give you some info how to do so yourself).  
                                                                                 
Hope to see you there!
