## The regular session is done

The 87th Session of the Texas Legislature started on January 12 and ended on May 31, 140 days, as prescribed by the Texas Constitution.  

## You had 8 jobs. Well, 9

The Republican Party of Texas (i.e., delegates like us) prescribed [eight Legislative Priorities](https://www.texasgop.org/legislative-priorities-report-6-6-21/):  

1. Election Integrity

2. Religious Freedom

3. Children and Gender Modification (banning child sex-change practices)

4. Abolition of Abortion

5. Constitutional Carry

6. Monument Protection

7. School Choice

8. Ban Taxpayer-Funded Lobbying

...and subsequently amended the list to nine priorities, adding executive overreach, to the Republican dominated 87th Legislature.  

## Our speaker: Brandon Waltens of Texas Scorecard

**[Texas Scorecard](https://texasscorecard.com/)** provides Texans with news and information about many issues facing the Lone Star State with a focus that is consistent with the principles of individual liberty and free markets.  They are always on the front lines in publicizing what happens when the Texas Legislature is in session (and around the state all the time).  

## Brandon previewed the upcoming session last November. Now the recap... 

**For our June meeting he'll be here with the recap.** He'll discuss the Good, the Bad, and the Ugly results of the 87th Texas Legislative Session and also what is in store for the one or more Special Session(s) yet to come.
