## Happy New Year!

Haven’t seen y’all for two months!  

## Election season is here. *<span class="hilite">In many ways the primary elections are the most important</span>*

Election season is here. ***The Primary Election will be held on March 5*** and early voting will start on February 20, just a few weeks away from now.   

The ballot will have 23 federal, statewide and county races plus 13 Republican Propositions. We need all the information we can absorb to make the best decisions possible.  

Guest speakers for our meeting will be:

**<span class="hilite">Maritza Sifuentez-Chavarria</span>** - running for District Attorney. [See her campaign website](https://maritzafordistrictattorney.com/new-home-copy)  

**<span class="hilite">Rick Davis</span>** - running for HD 14 State Representative. [Business website](https://www.attorneyrickdavis.com/)  

## Both races are a BIG DEAL

Maritza is running against a long-time incumbent. And the District 14 race will be a HUGE opportunity to replace a long-term, now retired RINO. **Make sure you make it to this meeting!!**  
 

Looking forward to seeing you again soon!
