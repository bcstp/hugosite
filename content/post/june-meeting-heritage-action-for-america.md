### **Accountability in the political world is much like a greased pig** _unless there is a coordinated effort to achieve that objective._

The [Heritage Foundation](https://www.heritage.org/) founded [Heritage Action for America](https://heritageaction.com/) with the goal of creating an organization that can take meaningful action to hold members of Congress accountable.

## Conservative principles to grassroots actionâ€”our call

**Rebekah Warwick** is the South Central Regional Coordinator for Heritage Action and will be our guest speaker for this meeting. Rebekah will explain how Heritage Action takes the conservative policy vision outlined by The Heritage Foundation and works with grassroots activists to make that vision successful.

Come and hear!
