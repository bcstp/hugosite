## We need ALL Texans to show support for our right to keep and bear arms!


### From the GOA:

> URGENT! ALL HANDS ON DECK! Gun freedom is critical to our safety and security — and if we don’t take action NOW we risk even more infringement. Join us to stand up for FREEDOM!  

> The Governor’s “Texas Safety Commission” is meeting at the Capitol at 10:30 on this same Thursday to discuss ways to keep guns away from people the government determines shouldn’t have guns. 

> The Governor has not allowed anyone from GOA-Texas or any other Texas gun rights organization to participate in this meeting. Even worse, he’s invited a gun control organization to give input.  (See the list of participants here: [https://gov.texas.gov/news/post/governor-abbott-announces-texas-safety-commission](https://gov.texas.gov/news/post/governor-abbott-announces-texas-safety-commission)) (EDIT: after much outcry, the Governor added a representative from TSRA. We still do not believe the Governor wants to protect your liberty, and this event is still needed.)

> Whether you carry a gun or not, your liberties are being threatened. 

> If they won’t listen to us inside the building, we will speak out outside the building.

> Please join our press conference where we explain our positions, and then walk with us down Congress Ave. in a peaceful protest march.
