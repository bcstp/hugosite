> ***<span style="color:#000;font-size:21px;">...we believe the future is dependent on how well we know the past, as well as how to apply it to our current situation.</span>*** <br />-- *True Texas Project*  

Our friends at [True Texas Project](https://truetexasproject.com/) are hosting speakers **Rick Green & Brad Stine** of Patriot Academy. This event will be at Life Church, 725 East Villa Maria Rd., Suite #3900 on **Tuesday, April 12th**, 6:30-8:30pm (note the venue change). They'll be presenting [Comedy and the Constitution](https://truetexasproject.com/event/apr-12-brazos-comedy-the-constitution/) as part of their Texas tour, and are asking that you [register, free of charge](https://www.patriotacademy.com/event/register/3416), for this event. 

The True Texas Project quote above sure goes along well with our *Teach, Empower, Act* slogan! We are grateful for all who are realizing that **the wisdom of our nation's founders** has been instrumental in how God has blessed us over the centuries, and that ***we are accountable* to Him (and to them) in applying this wisdom correctly**.
