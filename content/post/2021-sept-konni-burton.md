## We need the three branches of government. But four?

Many years of government corruption has brought us to a realization that there is another branch of government, the “Fourth Estate” which we know as the News Media.  

*The vast majority of **news today is either incomplete, distorted or both** in order to drive a particular narrative rather than report facts and allow the audience to make conclusions.*   

## Welcome Konni Burton

Our guest speaker will be **former state Senator [Konni Burton](https://thetexan.news/staff/)**, Founder and CEO of *[The Texan](https://thetexan.news/)*, a statewide political news organization.  *The Texan* is an alternative to the narratives and spin that is so pervasive in news media today and is **dedicated to providing readers with fact-based news regarding federal, state and local issues.**  

Check out more information about Konni and *The Texan* at **[TheTexan.news](https://thetexan.news/)**.  

Hope to see you on the 16th!
