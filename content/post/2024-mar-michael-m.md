## Bluebonnets and runoffs

Bluebonnets are out and the March 5 Primary Election is now history. **The Primary Runoff Election will be the held on May 28**, just enough time for our lives to get back to normal and then back in the political meat grinder for the runoff. Get ready for some professional mudslinging in the runoff.  

## For worse and for...better?

We will diverge from Texas and US. politics for this meeting and dive into current culture and political issues in Europe, specifically focusing on Germany. **Typically Europe experiences change on various fronts before these issues arrive in the United States** so it is important for us to be aware of whatâ€™s going on with the nations whose experiences may foreshadow our own.
