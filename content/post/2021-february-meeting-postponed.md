## February Meeting POSTPONED

## No meeting this week

Our regularly scheduled February meeting with Miguel Ángel Martín-Tortabu **is being postponed** due to the combination of power outages, freezing temps and dangerous driving conditions.  

Please watch your email and/or the B/CS Tea Party website, [bcsteaparty.com](https://www.bcsteaparty.com) for updates on rescheduling.  

Thanks, and stay safe and warm!
