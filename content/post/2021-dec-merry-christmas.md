The Bryan/College Station Tea Party will not have a meeting in December 2021.  

While this world has always been consumed with deception and chaos, the current conditions seem much worse and more intense that we have ever experienced. However, we must **<span class="hilite">hold fast to the promises in the Holy Scripture that God Almighty is all knowing, all seeing and all powerful and will deliver us through these conditions in His timing not ours.</span>**   

We pray that your Christmas will be filled with Joy and Peace in celebrating the birth of our LORD and Savior Jesus Christ.  

All the best of blessings to you and your family in the New Year!

And we'll be sending another email soon with info about upcoming events in the New Year. **SAVE THE DATE: Jan. 19!**
