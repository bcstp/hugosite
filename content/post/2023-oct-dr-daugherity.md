## Speaking of elections...

We have a General Election scheduled for **November 11**. Primary Election season is cranking up now and will continue until Election Day on **March 5, 2024**.    

## Elections are fully dependent on computer systems. <span class="hilite">ALL COMPUTERS ARE HACKABLE. THEREFORE ALL ELECTIONS ARE HACKABLE.</span> 

We live in a world of computers that touch almost every aspect of our culture. 
Electronic voting systems use computers to process our votes and as such have significant control over our way of life. Some voters trust the electronic systems without reservation while others have serious concern about trusting election results because reports of hacking into corporate and government computers has become commonplace.
