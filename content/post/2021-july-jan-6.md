## Confusion reigning

The Trump Rally in Washington DC on January 6, 2021 has been described in numerous ways, some being very convoluted. Network media has pounded their version relentlessly and alternative media has a different version. 

## "...the right of the people peaceably to assemble..."

US citizens gathered to show their support for Donald Trump and express their opinion about the 2020 election **as guaranteed by the 1st Amendment to the US Constitution.

<blockquote><span  class="hilite" style="font-weight:bold;">Congress shall make no law … prohibiting … the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.</span><span style="text-align:right;font-style:italic;display:block;margin-top: 5px;">- The Constitution of the United States, Amendment I</span></blockquote>

## Outside actors 

The rally became a sticky wicket when **outside actors generated violence, then 
Trump and his supporters were blamed for it.**   

## Eyewitness testimony

The program for this meeting will include eyewitness testimony about what they experienced at the rally and other information you may not be aware of.   

## What really happened

Plan on meeting with us to explore what really happened on January 6, 2021. Looking forward to another great meeting!
