## Parking (don't let this stop you!)

Parking for the MSC isn't bad, especially in the evening. There are two parking garages to choose from:

1. [The University Center Garage.](https://transport.tamu.edu/parkingmap/tsmap.htm?map=main&cit=20300) From George Bush Drive just east of Welborn Road, enter campus on Houston St. by the Association of Former Students building. Then, as you're passing Kyle Field on your left, the entrance to the parking garage will be on your right.
2. [The Gene Stallings Blvd Garage.](https://transport.tamu.edu/parkingmap/tsmap.htm?map=main&cit=20600) Enter campus from Welborn Road on Joe Routt Blvd. at the north end of Kyle Field. Then take your first left on Gene Stallings Blvd. and the parking garage will be on your left.  

### Paying

Watch the signage re paying. You'll get a ticket when you enter. Keep that with you, and **go the the garage lobby/entrance pay stations to pay *before*** returning to your vehicle. Then just scan your ticket as you're leaving and the gate will raise for you.  

There is **free 15-minute parking in the side driveway next to Rudder Tower** on Joe Routt Blvd.  You can use this when dropping  off or picking folks up.
