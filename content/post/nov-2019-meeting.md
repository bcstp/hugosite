## The 2019 General Election is done, so whatâ€™s next?

Bryan City Councilmember, Mike Southerland, was our guest speaker last month and will be back again with follow up comments on the results of the November 5 General Election and what to expect in the future. 

## Lone Star Agenda &mdash; with action items 

We discussed the [Lone Star Agenda, info here](/lone-star-agenda/) (and also [here](https://texasscorecard.com/state/lone-star-agenda-aims-to-unite-texas-republicans/) and [here](https://texasscorecard.com/state/lone-star-agenda-swells-with-signatures/)) a few months ago and now there is a call to action for the Grassroots of Texas. This effort can <strong  class="hilite">Keep Texas Red in 2020</strong> if we work together and stay focused on the timeless Principles of Liberty and Justice for All. **Come and hear how you can help!**

## Election Year 2020

2020 is a presidential election year and this one will be a doosie!  

We plan to have an **open discussion about possible future events** in 2020. Come prepared to share your thoughts about the year to come.  

We always have a great time together. See you there!
