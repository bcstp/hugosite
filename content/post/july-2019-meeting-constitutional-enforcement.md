## Constitutional Enforcement

### Our Path Back to Constitutional Government—this will NOT be done FOR us! WE must do this!

*The root cause of political problems in our blessed land is that the U.S. Constitution has been and continues to be ignored and not properly enforced.*  We all are aware of the multitude of activities that the federal government engages in that are not delegated to the feds in the Constitution. This situation will not change if we only complain and wait for someone else to take action.  

Tom Glass representing **[Texas Constitutional Enforcement](https://www.txce.org/)** will be our guest speaker and will discuss how Texas can take action to stop unconstitutional federal overreach.   

Looking forward to a great meeting. See you there!
