### Tracy Marshall - Chairman of the Board of Transparency Texas

Tracy received both her B.A. and her law degree from Duke University. She practiced employment law in the Dallas office of Gardere & Wynne and later with McKenna & Cuneo. After a few years, she “retired” from the law to focus on her family. She and Billy moved to Midland and have four kids between the ages of 17 and 23. In 2002, Tracy and Billy helped found the Grammar School at Midland Classical Academy, and Tracy served there for many years in various roles.  

In 2016, Tracy was able to meld her love for politics, Texas, and freedom by joining with several other concerned citizens to start Transparency Texas. When she’s not managing the website, Tracy enjoys working out and spending time with Billy and her kids.
