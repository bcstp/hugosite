## If you thought the general election had problems...

The 2020 General Election season has primarily been focused on the Presidential race but there are also many issues of concern here in the Lone Star State.  

## ...wait until you see the Texas legislature 

The 87th Session of the Texas Legislature will start on January 12 and continue until May 31. The race for Speaker of the Texas House is in process now. Will conservative issues have a decent chance for success in this legislative session? All of this and more will be the topics of discussion for this meeting.  

## There are, however, those with a consistent focus on individual liberty and free markets 

**[Empower Texans](https://empowertexans.com/) and [Texas Scorecard](https://texasscorecard.com/)** provide Texans with news and information about many issues facing the Lone Star State with a focus that is consistent with the principles of individual liberty and free markets.  They are always in high gear during the Texas Legislative Session publicizing important issues loud and clear.  

## Let's welcome Brandon Waltens

**Brandon Waltens** serves as the Capitol Bureau Chief and Managing Editor for Texas Scorecard.  Brandon will be our speaker and will be discussing what we can expect in the 87th Texas Legislative Session.
