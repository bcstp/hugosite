## Heritage Action Mission:

Heritage Action’s unique strategy combines inside-the-Beltway lobbying with outside-the-Beltway grassroots pressure. They communicate directly with lawmakers in Congress and in our state capitals and work with grassroots on the ground to know the issues and take effective action to influence the legislative process. Through this strategy Heritage Action works to bring about the conservative policies that hold true to our Founding Fathers’ ideals. Heritage Action exists to ensure that these ideals are not only maintained but flourish, both now and for future generations.
