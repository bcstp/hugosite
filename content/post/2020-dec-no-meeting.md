The Bryan/College Station Tea Party will not have a meeting in December.  

Although the current conditions in the U.S. cause us great concern for the future, we must not allow the things of this world to steal our faith in the Lord God Almighty.   

Our prayer is that the blessing of Christmas will fill your life with Joy and Peace. All the Best to you and your family during this wonderful season!
