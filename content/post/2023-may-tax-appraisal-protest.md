## Have you seen your property tax appraisal?! 

Brazos County Appraisal District sent out appraisal notices recently and most people are shocked by the increase in their property valuation, **<span class="hilite" style="font-size: 24px;">some as high as an increase of 48%</span>**.  

This is why many people want to eliminate property tax and replace it with an equitable alternative AND have reasonable reform in the expense of local government and public education.  

## The deadline to protest your Brazos County property tax appraisal is <span class="hilite">May 24</span>.  

The speaker will be Michael Berlanga. ***He is the real deal on property tax issues.*** This event was put on by former State Rep. Fred Brown.
