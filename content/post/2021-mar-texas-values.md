## Fighting for faith, family, and freedom in Texas

Our guest speaker will be [Jonathan Covey](https://txvalues.org/), the Director of Policy for Texas Values, a nonprofit group dedicated to fighting for faith, family, and freedom in the state of Texas.  

The Texas Values mission is to preserve and advance a culture of family values in the state of Texas.
The Texas Values vision is to stand for **biblical, Judeo-Christian values** by ensuring Texas is a state in which ***religious liberty flourishes, families prosper, and every human life is valued.***  

## Promoting our values

Texas Values promotes our core values of faith, family, and freedom in Texas through:  

- Policy research
- Public education and standing for truth in the media
- Grassroots mobilization
- Voter education
- Reviewing legislation and providing legal analysis
- Testifying at the Texas Legislature, State Board of Education, and other governmental entities

## Also, big tech... they benefit from you, then turn around and work against you. Let's back out of this "relationship"

### *Escaping* Big Tech (postponed from last month)

Facebook, Google, and other companies offer useful services, for “free.” In return, they get a “free” product&mdash;YOU!  

Will Butcher and Mark Coppock will give a short talk about the benefits of removing ourselves and our information from these privacy-stealing companies. **We will offer to help you in this process** (it *is* a process), and part of this presentation will be used to find out the best way for us to do that.   

## Looking forward to another great time together!
