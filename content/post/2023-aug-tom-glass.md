## Tom Glass bio

Tom has spent his life working for limited government in various ways. Since retirement from his career in information technology from ExxonMobil, he has spent full time at the last five Texas legislative sessions, pushing liberty issues that he thinks important. He spends his time there pushing back against daggers pointed at the heart of what Texans hold dear.  

Tom is the founder and leader of [Texas Constitutional Enforcement](https://www.txce.org/), which focuses on how Texas elected officials can stop the feds from violating the U.S. Constitution in Texas and stop Texas election officials from violating the Texas Constitution.  

Tom also runs several other groups, including Facebook groups [Texas Legislative Priorities](https://www.facebook.com/groups/texaslegislativepriorities), focused on seeing that the legislative priorities and other platform planks of the Republican Party of Texas are enacted, and [Protect the Texas Grid](https://www.facebook.com/groups/protecttexasgrid), focused on hardening the grid against all hazards.  

Tom served as the 2022 RPT Platform Committee representative from SD 18 after running that year for State Rep in HD 17. In late 2021, he was honored to be a recipient of a Texas Conservative Leader Award, and recently received one of two 2023 Fearless Conservative Awards from Grassroots America We the People.
Tom is a graduate of Odessa Permian High School, earned a Chemical Engineering degree from Texas A&M University, an MBA from Harvard Business School, and a J.D. from the University of Houston Law Center.
