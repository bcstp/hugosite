## It's *OUR* Money â€“ What Are *THEY* Going To Do With It?  

The 88th Session of the Texas Legislature will convene on January 10, 2023.  

Texas Comptroller Glen Hagar recently announced a <strong><span class="hilite">huge budget surplus of almost <span style="font-size: 24px;">$27 Billion</span></span></strong> to work with during the upcoming legislative session. In the past, Texas lawmakers have struggled with returning any significant amount of a budget surplus to average Texans.

Our guest speaker for this meeting will be <strong><span class="hilite">Wallace Johnson</span></strong>, Chairman of Robertson County Republican Party, Wildlife Rancher, Oil Field Geologist, a patriot and friend.
