## Economics Literacy. More, please!

We welcome Loren Spivack “The Free Market Warrior” back to Brazos County as the guest speaker for our April meeting. Loren devotes much of his time to teaching conservative groups about free market economics and has conducted his famous "Economic Literacy" seminars across the United States.  

## Economics that we can understand

Typically, a discussion on economics is tuned to terms and numbers over everyone’s head. Loren explains **economics with common sense and common language coupled with wit and wisdom.** This will be an evening filled with information and humor that you do not want to miss!
