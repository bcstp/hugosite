## Gun Rights advanced in Texas last week!

Constitutional Carry passed the TX House (State Representative Matt Schaeferâ€™s bill HB 1927) for the first time in Texas history, and we got a step closer to joining 30 other states with some form of permit-less carry.  

### It has passed the House and needs to be passed by the senate. Now the Texas Senate needs to hear from us.
